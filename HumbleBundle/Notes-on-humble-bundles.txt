NOTES ON HUMBLE BUNDLE URLS AND HTML PAGES
==========================================

URLS
----

AFIAK (as of November 2022), URLs of non-monthly humble bundles look like
	1. https://www.humblebundle.com/games/«BASENAME»
	2. https://www.humblebundle.com/books/«BASENAME»
	3. https://www.humblebundle.com/software/«BASENAME»
    or	4. https://www.humblebundle.com/«BASENAME»
where «BASENAME» contains no slashes (and, BTW, does not end with .htm[l] etc).

The fourth format is used for big multi-vendor bundles like the “Humble Conquer
COVID-19 bundle” and the “Humble Stand with Ukraine Bundle” (for example,
“https://www.humblebundle.com/conquer-covid19-bundle”).

The monthly bundles from Humble Choice each have pages with URLs like
	https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription/january-2022
    or	https://www.humblebundle.com/membership/february-2022
but (IIRC) the bundles from the previous Humble Monthly feature did not get
their own pages.
