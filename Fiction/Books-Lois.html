<h1>A Bujold Reading-Order Guide</h1>

<h2>The Fantasy Novels</h2>
<p>
My fantasy novels are not hard to order. Easiest of all is <i>The Spirit
Ring</i>, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed books that
for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are
the four volumes of <i>The Sharing Knife</i> — in order, <i>Beguilement</i>,
<i>Legacy</i>, <i>Passage</i>, and <i>Horizon</i> — which I broke down and
actually numbered, as this was one continuous tale divided into
non-wrist-breaking chunks. It has a stand-alone codicil novella, “Knife
Children”.
<p>
What were called the Chalion books after the setting of its first two volumes,
but which now that the geographic scope has widened I’m dubbing the World of the
Five Gods, were written to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and can in
theory be read in any order. Some readers think the world-building is easier to
assimilate when the books are read in publication order, and the second volume
certainly contains spoilers for the first (but not the third.) In any case, the
publication order is:<ul>
<li><i>The Curse of Chalion</i>
<li><i>Paladin of Souls</i>
<li><i>The Hallowed Hunt</i></ul>
<p>
In terms of internal world chronology, <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i> would fall
first, the Penric &amp; Desdemona novellas perhaps a hundred and fifty years
later, and <i>The Curse of Chalion</i> and <i>Paladin of Souls</i> would follow
a century or so after that.
<p>
The internal chronological order of the Penric tales is presently:
<ol>
<li>“Penric’s Demon”
<li>“Penric and the Shaman”
<li>“Penric’s Fox”
<li>“Masquerade in Lodi”
<li>“Penric’s Mission”
<li>“Mira’s Last Dance”
<li>“The Prisoner of Limnos”
<li>“The Orphans of Raspay”
<li>“The Physicians of Vilnoc”
<li><i>The Assassins of Thasalon</i>
<li>“Knot of Shadows”
</ol>
<p>
The nine first-published of these have been collected in three Baen Books paper
editions: <i>Penric’s Progress</i>, containing “Demon”, “Shaman”, and
“Fox”: <i>Penric’s Travels</i>, containing “Mission”, “Mira”, and “Limnos”; and
<i>Penric’s Labors</i>, containing “Masquerade”, “Orphans”,
and “Physicians”.

<h2>Other Original E-books</h2>
<p>
The short story collection <i>Proto Zoa</i> contains five very early tales —
three (1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction — all previously
published but not in this handy format. The novelette “Dreamweaver’s Dilemma”
may be of interest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is the first story in which
that proto-universe began, mentioning Beta Colony but before Barrayar was even
thought of.
<p>
<i>Sidelines: Talks and Essays</i> is just what it says on the tin — a
collection of three decades of my nonfiction writings, including convention
speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions, and some less formal pieces. I
hope it will prove an interesting companion piece to my fiction.
<p>
<i>The Gerould Family of New Hampshire in the Civil War: Two Diaries and a
Memoir</i> is a compilation of historical documents handed down from my mother’s
father’s side of my family. A meeting of time, technology, and skillset has
finally allowed me to put them into a sharable form.

<h2>The Vorkosigan Stories</h2>
<p>
Many pixels have been expended debating the ‘best’ order in which to read what
have come to be known as the Vorkosigan Books (or Saga), the Vorkosiverse, the
Miles books, and other names. The debate mainly revolves around publication
order versus internal-chronological order. I favor internal chronological, with
a few adjustments.
<p>
It was always my intention to write each book as a stand-alone, so that the
reader could theoretically jump in anywhere. While still somewhat true, as the
series developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that
were richer for each other. I will list the sub-arcs, and then the books, and
then the duplication warnings. (My publishing history has been complex.) And
then the publication order, for those who want it.
<p>
<i>Shards of Honor</i> and <i>Barrayar</i>. The first two books in the series
proper, they detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral
Vorkosigan of Barrayar. <i>Shards</i> was my very first novel ever;
<i>Barrayar</i> was actually my eighth, but continues the tale the next day
after the end of Shards. For readers who want to be sure of beginning at the
beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two.
<p>
<i>The Warrior’s Apprentice</i> and <i>The Vor Game</i> (with, perhaps, the
novella “The Mountains of Mourning” tucked in between.) <i>The Warrior’s
Apprentice</i> introduces the character who became the series’ linchpin, Miles
Vorkosigan; the first book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by
accident; the second how he fixed his mistakes from the first round. Space opera
and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things one can best discover
for oneself), The Warrior’s Apprentice makes another good place to jump into the
series for readers who prefer a young male protagonist.
<p>
After that: <i>Brothers in Arms</i> should be read before <i>Mirror Dance</i>,
and both, ideally, before <i>Memory</i>.
<p>
<i>Komarr</i> makes another alternate entry point for the series, picking up
Miles’s second career at its start. It should be read before <i>A Civil
Campaign</i>.
<p>
<i>Borders of Infinity</i>, a collection of three of the six currently extant
novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure sampler platter, I
always thought, for readers who don’t want to commit themselves to length. (But
it may make more sense if read after <i>The Warrior’s Apprentice</i>.) Take care
not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its title story, “The Borders of
Infinity”.
<p>
<i>Falling Free</i> takes place 200 years earlier in the timeline and does not
share settings or characters with the main body of the series. Most readers
recommend picking up this story later. It should likely be read
before <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>, however, which revisits the “quaddies”, a
bioengineered race of free-fall dwellers, in Miles’s time.
<p>
The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear in plain text; the
novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words and 40,000 words)
in quote marks.
<ul>
<li><i>Falling Free</i>
<li><i>Shards of Honor</i>
<li><i>Barrayar</i>
<li><i>The Warrior’s Apprentice</i>
<li>“The Mountains of Mourning”
<li>“Weatherman”
<li><i>The Vor Game</i>
<li><i>Cetaganda</i>
<li><i>Ethan of Athos</i>
<li><i>Borders of Infinity</i>
<li>“Labyrinth”
<li>“The Borders of Infinity”
<li><i>Brothers in Arms</i>
<li><i>Mirror Dance</i>
<li><i>Memory</i>
<li><i>Komarr</i>
<li><i>A Civil Campaign</i>
<li>“Winterfair Gifts”
<li><i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>
<li><i>Captain Vorpatril’s Alliance</i>
<li>“The Flowers of Vashnoi”
<li><i>CryoBurn</i>
<li><i>Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen</i>
</ul>
<p>
Caveats:
<p>
The novella “Weatherman” is an out-take from the beginning of the novel <i>The
Vor Game</i>. If you already have <i>The Vor Game</i>, you likely don’t need
this.
<p>
The original ‘novel’ <i>Borders of Infinity</i> was a fix-up collection
containing the three novellas “The Mountains of Mourning”, “Labyrinth”, and “The
Borders of Infinity”, together with a frame to tie the pieces together. Again,
beware duplication. The frame story does not stand alone.

<h3>Publication order:</h3>
<p>
This is also the order in which the works were written, apart from a couple of
the novellas, but is not identical to the internal-chronological. It goes:<ul>
<li><i>Shards of Honor</i> (June 1986)
<li><i>The Warrior’s Apprentice</i> (August 1986)
<li><i>Ethan of Athos</i> (December 1986)
<li><i>Falling Free</i> (April 1988)
<li><i>Brothers in Arms</i> (January 1989)
<li><i>Borders of Infinity</i> (October 1989)
<li><i>The Vor Game</i> (September 1990)
<li><i>Barrayar</i> (October 1991)
<li><i>Mirror Dance</i> (March 1994)
<li><i>Cetaganda</i> (January 1996)
<li><i>Memory</i> (October 1996)
<li><i>Komarr</i> (June 1998)
<li><i>A Civil Campaign</i> (September 1999)
<li><i>Diplomatic Immunity</i> (May 2002)
<li>“Winterfair Gifts” (February 2004)
<li><i>CryoBurn</i> (November 2010)
<li><i>Captain Vorpatril’s Alliance</i> (November 2012)
<li><i>Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen</i> (February 2016)
<li>“The Flowers of Vashnoi” (May 2018)
</ul>
