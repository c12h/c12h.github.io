<h1>Fiction by Rosemary Sutcliff</h1>
<p>
<a href="Rosemary_Sutcliff">Rosemary Sutcliff</a>
(1920-1992) wrote historical fiction, mostly for children.

<h2>Major series</h2>
<details><summary>About Sutcliff’s series</summary>
<p>
Sutcliff did not intentionally write multi-book series (except, probably, for
her ‘mythic’ Arthurian trilogy), but several of her books, starting with <i>The
Eagle of the Ninth</i> (1954), are linked by mentions of an emerald ring.  These
are known as the “Eagle of the Ninth” <em>series</em> (AKA the “Marcus” series). 
Three of the early books in this series are known as the "Eagle of the Ninth"
<em>trilogy</em>.  Confused? <i>Caveat lector!</i>
<p>
Two of these books involve Artos (a realistic version of King Arthur).  He
appears in <i>The Lantern Bearers</i> and narrates <i>Sword at Sunset</i>. 
Another novel, <i>Tristan and Iseult</i>, which is not in the ‘Eagle’ series, is
part of her realistic take on Arthurian myth.
<p>
Later she wrote an Arthurian trilogy inspired by <i>Le Morte d’Arthur</i> and
other ancient texts; naturally, these are less realistic.  The 2nd of these was
published in 1979 and the 1st and 3rd in 1981, suggesting that this was planned
as a trilogy.
